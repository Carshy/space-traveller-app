# Space Travelers Hub

The Space Travelers' Hub is a web application that showcases Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section. The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking. The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status, a button that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier. The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.
